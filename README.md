Digital solutions have the ability to completely change the way that drug abuse is prevented and treated, as well as other high-risk lifestyle behaviours like gambling. This article intends to advance the creation of digital solutions to increase the effectiveness and facilitate the use of brief treatments in the areas of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, prescription or illegal drug use, and gambling.

# How can digital solutions be incorporated into the healthcare system to make them useful tools that both patients and healthcare professionals can use?

There are several ways that digital technologies may be integrated into the healthcare sector. For instance, digital technologies may be incorporated into current healthcare systems to enable physicians to deliver quick interventions that are more effective. These resources can also help patients who are trying to cut down or quit using drugs or alcohol. Digital tools may also be utilized to improve communication between patients, doctors, and other medical specialists including psychologists and social workers.
Health practitioners need to be given the required training and assistance to use the tools effectively if digital solutions are to be successfully incorporated into the healthcare system. This entails giving medical practitioners the know-how and resources they need to use the technologies and access to the most recent studies and evidence-based best practices. Additionally, health practitioners must be able to decide which digital tools are most appropriate for a given case and know how to utilize them efficiently.
Health apps are just another way that digital solutions may be integrated into the healthcare system. Patients can obtain self-help materials including advice on how to cut back on or quit using drugs and alcohol through the usage of health apps. Health applications may also be used to monitor a patient's development and provide them with individualized feedback.
Last but not least, digital tools can help medical personnel perform quick treatments. Digital tools, for instance, may be utilized to give access to evidence-based therapies and the capability for health practitioners to track the success of their patients. This can aid in ensuring that solutions are tailored to each patient's unique needs.

# What can research do to make it easier to include digital solutions into long-term, comprehensive strategies?

The integration of digital solutions into expansive, sustainable ways can be greatly aided by research. Research may be utilized, for instance, to determine which digital technologies are most suited for assisting quick interventions in the use of alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, prescription or illegal drugs, and gambling. This will enable medical practitioners to choose the best digital tools for their unique circumstance and make sure that they are being used to their full potential.
Additionally, research may be utilized to assess how well digital solutions work to prevent substance abuse and treat other high-risk lifestyle behaviours. This will make it possible for medical practitioners to choose the best digital tools for their patients and use them in the most efficient way possible.
Research may also be utilized to pinpoint the enablers and impediments to the adoption of digital technologies within the healthcare system. This might involve determining the difficulties that healthcare professionals have while implementing digital technologies as well as the possible advantages that may result from their use. Using this knowledge, strategies may be created to guarantee that digital solutions are fully integrated into the healthcare system and utilized to their full potential.
Last but not least, research may be utilized to examine the possibility of using digital solutions for extensive, long-term prevention and treatment of drug abuse and other high-risk lifestyle behaviours. This will make it possible for policymakers and medical experts to create strategies specifically targeted to the demands of the general public and the individual patient.

# What unmet preventive and treatment needs exist for drug abuse and other high-risk lifestyle behaviours, and how many digital solutions help?

Numerous unmet needs in the prevention and treatment of drug abuse and other high-risk lifestyle behaviours can be addressed with the help of digital solutions. Digital technologies, for instance, may be utilized to give patients access to therapies that are supported by evidence and the capacity to monitor their progress. This can aid in ensuring that solutions are tailored to each patient's unique needs.
Digital solutions may also be utilized to give medical personnel access to the most recent studies and best practices. This can guarantee that actions are based on the best data and are applied in the most efficient way possible.
Digital tools may also be utilized to help patients and medical personnel communicate with one another. This can guarantee that therapies are tailored to each patient's unique requirements and that they receive the assistance they need to cut down or quit using drugs.
Finally, digital solutions may be utilized to give patients access to self-help materials including advice and guidance on how to cut back or quit using drugs. This can guarantee that therapies are tailored to each patient's unique requirements and that they receive the assistance they need to cut down or quit using drugs.
The prevention and treatment of drug abuse and other high-risk lifestyle behaviors might be revolutionized by digital technologies.

Health professionals and policy makers may guarantee that treatments are personalized to meet the specific requirements of each patient as well as the needs of the larger population by integrating digital solutions into the healthcare system and utilizing research to determine the most efficient techniques. The toll that drug abuse and other high-risk lifestyle behaviors take on people, their families, and society at large can be lessened as a result.
